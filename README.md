The RipTide Interactive produced Client Management System will be a 'template' Software
as a Service. Ideally, a company can consult with me to produce a unique and individual CMS
system for their needs.

# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}
- The Dashboard is an individual web page, it dynamically features a client counter straight from the database.
- The Clients page is also an individual page that features sub-pages to control CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). This allows you to view the clients in the database, it is fully dynamic by utilizing subscribe().
- The Add New Client page is a sub web page, it allows a user to create a new client that is instantly submitted to the database via the backend/API.
- The View Client button is a sub-page that allows a user to view the details of a client.
- The edit client button is a sub-page that allows a user to edit details of a client, it is done dynamically as well.
